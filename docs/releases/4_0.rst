New in Version 4.0.0
--------------------

This version adds the following features, outlined below. Please note that
pVACtools 4.0 is not backwards-compatible and certain changes will break old
workflows.

Breaking Changes
________________

- pVACseq|pVACfuse|pVACbind report files have been reformatted to add some
  additional information and, in the case of pVACfuse and pVACbind, remove
  columns where all values were ``NA``. Existing output files will no longer
  work with the standalone commands as well as pVACview.
- The format of the Mutation Position column has been updated to no longer use
  0 and n+1 to denote mutations starting beofre or ending after the epitope.
  This column now only shows the acutally mutated positions.

New Features
____________

- We now support MHCflurry and NetMHCpanEL elution algorithms.
- Users are now able to specific amino acids that would be problematic for
  vaccine manufacturing and have the pipelines mark epitopes with such amnio
  acids.
- The aggregate report now takes into account many command line thresholds
  when tiering candidates. We also refined the way we determine the Best
  Peptide to take into account the biotype and TSL of the transcripts coding
  for the peptide, and whether or not the candidate has any problematic
  positions or fails the anchor criteria. Please see the :ref:`output file
  section <pvacseq_best_peptide>` of the documentation for more details.
- pVACview has been updated with a host of new features

  - Users may adjust a wider variety of thresholds for retiering.
  - Users are now able to reset the tiering thresholds to the ones originally
    used when running pVACview.
  - Transcripts resulting in the same set of epitope candidates are now
    grouped together to make it easier to identify unique candidates.
  - Elution data is displayed in the epitope details section of pVACview.
  - Reference match details are displayed in the transcript set details
    section of pVACview.

- pVACfuse now supports output files from Arriba for fusion peptide
  predictions.
- Users may provide an optional STAR-fusion output files to their pVACfuse run
  in order to extract expression and read support data for their candidates.
  These will be used for filtering, as well as for tiering in the aggregate
  report. Please see the :ref:`output file section <pvacfuse_output_files>` of the documention for
  more details.

How To Contribute
=================

pVACtools is an open-source project. We enthusiastically welcome outside contributions.

The `pVACtools source code <https://github.com/griffithlab/pVACtools>`_ is hosted on GitHub.
Code changes are made via pull requests to the main repository.
The `First Contributions
<https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions>`_ project has a
neat guide of all the steps involved.

One thing to note is that the pVACtools project uses ``staging`` and
``hotfix`` branches to manage major/minor and patch releases, respectively.
Depending on the type of your contribution you will
need to branch your change branch off of either ``staging`` for new features
or ``hotfix`` for bugfixes and use one these two branches as the base branch
of your pull request. Pull requests should never be made to the ``master``
branch.

The pVACtools projects uses milestones to assign issues to specific releases.
Each milestone is named with a version number, which indicates the version of
the upcoming release. Upcoming milestones/versions can be found `here
<https://github.com/griffithlab/pVACtools/milestones>`_. An issue in an open
milestone may be closed if the respective feature has been addressed (i.e.
added via a merged pull request), even though the release for the open
milestone has not been made yet. Therefore, a closed issue does not indicate
that a feature is already available in a release yet. We urge users to
also search closed issues for any problem they may encounter and to check
whether a desired feature addition has already been made but isn't released
yet.
